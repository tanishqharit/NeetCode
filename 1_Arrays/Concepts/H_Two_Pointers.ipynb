    "Two Pointers\n",
    "- Core Idea: We’ve already seen a variation of this method in the sliding window technique (which also uses two pointers). But unlike sliding window, the two pointers technique does not always require a fixed or variable window. Instead, the pointers can move independently depending on the problem’s conditions.\n",
    "- So, we focus more on the pointers rather than the window.\n",
    "- Maintain 2 pointers at L (left) and R (right). They can both start at the beginning of the array, the end or even at different places depending upon the problem.\n",
    "- Shrinking Window Technique: Start the L pointer at 0 and R pointer at len-1. Increment L or decrement R or both until both the pointers meet each other."
