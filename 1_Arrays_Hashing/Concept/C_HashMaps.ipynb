    "1. Python Dictionary Data Structure.\n",
    "2. Difference between a set and a map is that in sets contain keys only, while maps contain key-value pairs.\n",
    "3. When questions use the workds \"unique\", \"count\", or \"frequency\", it is almost certain a hashmap or hashset will be useful for solving the problem.\n",
    "4. The Insert, Remove and Search operation in Hash Map is O(1).\n",
    "5. The downside of hash maps is that they are NOT ORDERED, so it not possible to traverse the keys of a hashmap in any particular order. If we want to iterate through all the keys, we would first need to sort them, which will run in O(n log n) time, making it slower.\n",
    "6. Because hashmaps don't allow duplicates and have key-value pairs, used to count the frequency of keys."
